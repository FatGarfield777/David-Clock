# David Clock

A creative digital clock that displays time using mathematical expressions. Each number is represented by a randomly generated LaTeX mathematical equation that evaluates to that number.

## Features

- Real-time clock display using mathematical expressions
- Dynamic LaTeX rendering
- Various mathematical concepts including:
  - Square roots
  - Exponents
  - Pythagorean triples
  - Prime numbers
  - Factorials
  - Fibonacci sequences
  - And more!

## How It Works

The clock converts regular time numbers into mathematical expressions using LaTeX notation. These expressions are then rendered using the CodeCogs LaTeX renderer. The display updates every minute for minutes and every hour for hours.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- CodeCogs LaTeX Renderer

## Usage

You can open this website in your browser by either:
- Downloading, cloning, or forking the repository and opening index.html in the web
- Or opening the [github pages site](fatgarfield777.github.io/David-Clock)

## Credits

This project was heavily inspired by [@enjeck's num2math](https://github.com/enjeck/num2math), which converts numbers into mathematical expressions. The core mathematical conversion logic has been adapted from their work.
